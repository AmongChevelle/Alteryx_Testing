Release Note
•

The Q2 2022 Business Insights Data (US) provides updated household and population data as well
as additional updated datasets for CAPE and Mosaic Allocate datasets. The experimental 2020
ACS wasn’t advised for use; therefore, Experian has provided the same ACS 2019 data that
currently is available.
o Detailed information on changes in this CAPE release can be found in the
CAPE_2022_Tech_Overview.docx provided in the Documentation\Experian\CAPE
directory.

•

NAICS codes are updated every five years, and we have updated the NAICS codes referenced by
Dun & Bradstreet data to represent the 2022 NAICS update. The updated NAICS Lookup Table
ahs been provided in Documentation\DNB\NAICS Codes.xlsx

•

Due to a lack of updated data, Kalibrate informed us the Q2 release data was the same as the Q1
release data. We updated the names to reflect the current vintage and have been informed that
the Q3 2022 dataset will have new and updated TraffixMetrix data.

•

The CASS US June 2022 install provides the latest license for CASS, which otherwise expires in late
July. The CASS US April 2022 dataset also provided this license update.

•

The Allocate Consumer Expenditure Detail Comparison reports for five-year projections have
been corrected to represent the expected year (2027).

Overview
The Data (US) includes the following components –
▪
▪
▪
▪
▪

Spatial – Geocoder, Reverse geocoder, ZIP+4 Coder, Address Points, CASS, drive time engine,
Alteryx Maps, USGS Maps and Mapbox satellite imagery
Geodemographics - Experian CAPE, Mosaic segmentation system, American Community Survey
(ACS), EASI Demographics US Census 2000, US Census 2010 SF1 and D&B Business Summary
Experian ConsumerView Household and Individual analytical file
D&B Firmographics/Business location analytical file
Kalibrate Technologies Traffic Counts

Spatial
These products provide a visual display or add spatial dimension to files through address cleansing,
geocoding and drive time creation.
▪ Address Points includes 102 million parcel centroids, a parcel is the property boundary of an
address; most of the points in the database are the centroid of the property boundary.
However, some of the points are edited by TomTom to rooftop accuracy and can enhance
geocoding results.
▪ Alteryx Maps enhances mapping with atlas-like reference layers.
▪ Geocoder adds a spatial object (latitude/longitude) to addresses for visualization and data
retrieval processes.
▪ Reverse geocoder - produces a record-for-record reverse geocode result which includes
formatted address fields and lat/lon coordinates. This tool requires internet access. For
additional information refer to Alteryx Help.
▪ ZIP+4 Coder adds spatial objects at multiple levels: ZIP Code, ZIP +2 and ZIP +4.
▪ CASS offers address clean up and standardization for better data matching processes and
geocoding.
▪ The drive time engine creates polygons or measurements between points based upon distance
or speed for visualization and reporting. Drive times can be created using Peak, OffPeak and
Night traffic speeds, for details refer to the document ‘Alteryx Drive time Speed Category
Enhancement’ in the Documentation folder.

Demographic Datasets
The Experian data install includes the following datasets and along with Mosaic and Mosaic Workplace is
collectively referred to as CAPE in Experian’s release/methodology document.

EASI Demographics US Census 20005

Experian ConsumerView Analytical File
Experian’s data warehouse of consumer demographics, self-reported, life event, direct response, property
and mortgage information. Additional fields that can be licensed to the Analytical file include aggregated
auto, aggregated credit and additional direct response and property and mortgage information and Ethnic
Insight. As the largest and most comprehensive resource for both list services and data enhancement
available today — including data on more than 235 million consumers and 113 million households in the
U.S. — ConsumerView offers core consumer data assets overlaid with behavioral and retail purchasing
data. This combination results in the deepest and most granular insight into who your customers really
are. Further leverage the file by licensing individual names and household addresses to accurately target,
segment and enrich existing customer data to improve campaign response rates, strengthen brand loyalty
and significantly increase revenue.
Released quarterly, household fields include Mosaic Household and ZIP4, mail order buyer preferences,
mortgage/home purchase, median family income, estimated income, dwelling type, and presence of
children under 18. At the Individual level, marital status, gender, education and occupation group. For the
complete variable list, refer to the Documentation folder of the install.
Several fields are not included in the output although they can be queried so if you wish to license these
fields please contact your Alteryx Sales Representative.

D&B Business Summary Data
DUN & BRADSTREET (“D&B”) is the world’s leading source of commercial information and insight on
businesses, enabling companies to Decide with Confidence® for over 165 years. D&B’s global commercial
database contains more than 125 million business records. The database is enhanced by D&B’s
proprietary DUNSRight® Quality Process, which provides customers with quality business information.
This quality information is the foundation of our global solutions that customers rely on to make critical
business decisions. Using the D&B Business Location file, Alteryx developed a geofirmographic dataset by
summarizing the D&B data by SIC codes at the block group level and organized the data by Employees and
Establishments.

D&B Business Location Analytical File
The U.S. file contains over 23 million business locations in the US and is released quarterly. Fields included
in the file are Business Name, Sales Volume, Number of Employees as well as SIC and NAICS code. For the
complete variable list, refer to the Documentation folder of the install. Please note that several fields are
not included in the output although they can be queried so if you wish to license these fields, please
contact your Alteryx Sales Representative.

Kalibrate Technologies Traffic Counts
Kalibrate Technologies offers the most complete U.S. database of published traffic count data
commercially available. Data is continuously updated for all road types – from freeways in the nation’s
largest metropolitan areas to roads in rural areas. Traffic count data is collected from almost 6,000 city,
state and federal organizations nationwide and assembled into a common geographic database format

The US Census 2000 data document is not included in Experian CAPE release/methodology documentation nor

release. The Documentation will continue to be provided in the main Documentation folder as well as
the Location Data Knowledge Base on the Community.

External hard drive return
After the data installation is complete and if possible, you have archived a copy of the data to a network
location or another external hard drive, the drive can be returned to Alteryx. The FedEx package the
external hard drive was shipped in can be used to return the drive back to Alteryx using the return label
included in the package.
